Qos is quality of service which refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanism rather than the achieved service quality
quality of service is the ability to provide diferrent priority to different applications,users,or data flows,or to guarantee a certain level of
performance to a data flow
There r two types of traffic shaping algorithms
1.Leaky Bucket
2.Token Bucket

The leaky bucket algorithm is a method of temporily storing a variable number of requests and organizing them into a set rate output of
packets in an asynchronous tranfer mode

references :
1. wikipedia to learn about Qos in computer networking
2. ksit cn lab manual to learn programming for leaky bucket and its working
3.learnt few programming concepts of c#

challenges:
1. it was difficult to implement ping request in c# language,which requires more knowledge about the programming language
2.able to implement the program at the basic level
